Write a program that accepts a price file of baby products(format below) as CSV file, and a list of products that someone wants to buy, and outputs the shop they should go to, and the total price it will cost them. It is okay to purchase extra products, as long as the total cost is minimized.

price file format
shop ID, price, product 1 label (single product)
shop ID, price, product 1 label, product 2 label, ... (combo packs with multiple products)

Shop IDs are integers, all products are lower case letters and underscores, and the price is a decimal number.
As per the challenge the program runs perfectly it is working on core java and made on eclipse mars .2
give path name as per your path of country.csv

enter the name of product and it will show its shop_id, price, product.
for eaxmple:-

Program Input

	program data.csv scissor

Expected Output
	=> 6, 11.0
